Some of them looked really tricky back in time... and they are still right now!! 

- Bingo card ğŸ¤¯ğŸ¤¯ğŸ¤¯ğŸ¤¯ğŸ¤¯ğŸ¤¯ğŸ¤¯ğŸ¤¯

in one and only one class create a bingo card with some conditions to bear in mind :
- Every row must have 5 figures and 4 gaps
- Every column must have its figures ordered in ascendent order
- First row only must allow numbers from 1 to 9 within a total of 9 values
- Second row only must allow numbers from 10 to 19 within a total of 10 values
- Third row only must allow numbers from 20 to 29 within a total of 9 values
- So on till last one that must have values from 80 to 90 within a total amount of 11 values
- There must be 3 columns within only one value. The rest of them must have 2.
- 2 columns in a row cannot have value or gap in the same position
